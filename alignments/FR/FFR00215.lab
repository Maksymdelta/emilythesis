well what should i say i english is almost becoming my favorite language  it\'s becoming harder and harder to speak french because there\'s nobody to speak french with me  it is quite easy for me to speak english with you on the telephone  a lot of my vocabulary i\'ve acquired since i\'ve been here is hard for me to think of
