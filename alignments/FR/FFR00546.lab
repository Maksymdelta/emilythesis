well at this point in my life i am just finishing my masters\' in french and i guess i\'m considering new options  will i go onto a ph d or am i likely to just stop right here and maybe get a certification of teaching in my state and start teaching high school  at this point i\'m just debating talking with my teachers and even my husband trying to seek some advice
