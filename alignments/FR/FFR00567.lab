here what i love is the ocean  i mean in city the ocean is very close and i can go every summer to swim surfing and everything  it\'s fun   but the only thing i don\'t like is there\'s too many tourist  and they drive very slow and very dangerously  but please don\'t make fun of my accent okay that would be very nice
